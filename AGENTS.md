All C# code changes must comply with these guidelines:

* Do not use `var`; declare variables with explicit types.
* Use native type keywords (e.g., `long` instead of `Int64`, `string` instead of `String`).
* Implement properties with explicit backing fields; avoid auto-properties.
* Avoid adding NuGet packages, except for dependencies used exclusively by the test suite.
